/// PlaybackSessionSuspendNetwork is used to suspend a specified session. The player will clear the stored item window of tracks and send a playbackStatus event to tell clients that the current item is null.
/// As described in a cloud queue use case in Play audio, if your app sends a play command when the cloud queue is empty, the player will attempt to resume playback of content that was playing prior to this command. For example, if the user was previously listening to a radio station or had a playlist queued, it will attempt to resume playback of that content.
/// When a session is suspended, the player wonâ€™t revert to the previous music source in this case. Instead, the player delivers a sessionInfo event with a suspended value of true for the suspended session.
